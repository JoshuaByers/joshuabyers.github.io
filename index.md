## Joshua Byers' GitHub Website

Welcome to my barebones GitHub website!

### Why I Created This Site

This website was created for [Boise State University's course on Git](https://www.boisestate.edu/registrar-catalog/course-catalog/cs-hu/). In the futue, I'd love to use this space to showcase my software projects.
